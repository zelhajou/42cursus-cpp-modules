### EX00

This exercise aims to teach and demonstrate the concept of polymorphism in C++, which is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP). Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
The exercise focuses on creating a base class `Animal` and derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` to illustrate how polymorphism works. Additionally, it introduces the concept of method overriding and the use of virtual functions.

## 1. Polymorphism

Polymorphism in C++ allows you to call derived class methods through a base class pointer or reference. It is mainly achieved through:

- **Function Overloading**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Operator Overloading**: Defining custom behavior for operators for user-defined types.
- **Virtual Functions**: Functions in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes to provide specific behavior.

## 2. Virtual Functions
A virtual function is a member function in the base class that you expect to override in derived classes.
When you refer to a derived class object using a base class pointer or reference, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class's version of the function.

## 3. Base and Derived Classes
In this exercise, we create a base class `Animal` and two derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`.

**Base Class `Animal`**

The Animal class has a protected attribute type and a virtual function makeSound:

```cpp
class Animal {
protected:
    std::string type;
public:
    Animal();
    Animal(const Animal& other);
    Animal& operator=(const Animal& other);
    virtual ~Animal();

    virtual void makeSound() const;
    std::string getType() const;
};
```

- **Protected Attribute**: Allows derived classes to access type.
- **Virtual Destructor**: Ensures the correct destructor is called for derived classes.
- **Virtual Function**: `makeSound` allows derived classes to provide their specific implementation.

**Derived Classes `Dog` and `Cat`**

These classes inherit from `Animal` and override the `makeSound` function:

```cpp
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog();
    Dog(const Dog& other);
    Dog& operator=(const Dog& other);
    ~Dog();

    void makeSound() const;
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    Cat();
    Cat(const Cat& other);
    Cat& operator=(const Cat& other);
    ~Cat();

    void makeSound() const;
};
```

- **Constructor**: Sets the type to "Dog" or "Cat" and prints a creation message.
- **Destructor**: Prints a destruction message.
- **Overridden Function**: Provides specific behavior for `makeSound`.

**Implementation**

The implementation of the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` classes is separated into `.cpp` files:

`Animal.cpp`

```cpp
#include "Animal.hpp"

Animal::Animal() : type("Animal") {
    std::cout << "Animal created.\n";
}

Animal::Animal(const Animal& other) : type(other.type) {
    std::cout << "Animal copied.\n";
}

Animal& Animal::operator=(const Animal& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
        type = other.type;
    }
    std::cout << "Animal assigned.\n";
    return *this;
}

Animal::~Animal() {
    std::cout << "Animal destroyed.\n";
}

void Animal::makeSound() const {
    std::cout << "Some generic animal sound.\n";
}

std::string Animal::getType() const {
    return type;
}
```

`Dog.cpp`

```
#include "Dog.hpp"

Dog::Dog() {
    type = "Dog";
    std::cout << "Dog created.\n";
}

Dog::Dog(const Dog& other) : Animal(other) {
    std::cout << "Dog copied.\n";
}

Dog& Dog::operator=(const Dog& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
        Animal::operator=(other);
    }
    std::cout << "Dog assigned.\n";
    return *this;
}

Dog::~Dog() {
    std::cout << "Dog destroyed.\n";
}

void Dog::makeSound() const {
    std::cout << "Woof!\n";
}
```

`Cat.cpp`

```cpp

#include "Cat.hpp"

Cat::Cat() {
    type = "Cat";
    std::cout << "Cat created.\n";
}

Cat::Cat(const Cat& other) : Animal(other) {
    std::cout << "Cat copied.\n";
}

Cat& Cat::operator=(const Cat& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
        Animal::operator=(other);
    }
    std::cout << "Cat assigned.\n";
    return *this;
}

Cat::~Cat() {
    std::cout << "Cat destroyed.\n";
}

void Cat::makeSound() const {
    std::cout << "Meow!\n";
}
```

## 4. Main Function

The main function demonstrates polymorphism by creating instances of `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` and calling their functions through base class pointers:

```cpp
int main() {
    const Animal* meta = new Animal();
    const Animal* j = new Dog();
    const Animal* i = new Cat();

    std::cout << j->getType() << " " << std::endl;
    std::cout << i->getType() << " " << std::endl;
    i->makeSound(); // will output the cat sound!
    j->makeSound(); // will output the dog sound!
    meta->makeSound(); // will output the generic animal sound!

    delete meta;
    delete j;
    delete i;

    return 0;
}
```

- **Base Class Pointers**: `meta`, `j`, and `i` are pointers to `Animal`, but point to `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` objects, respectively.
- **Polymorphic Behavior**: Calls to `makeSound` on these pointers result in the derived class versions being executed.
- **Destructor Calls**: Ensures proper cleanup by calling `delete` on each pointer.

## 5. WrongAnimal and WrongCat

These classes illustrate what happens if polymorphism is not correctly implemented:

```cpp
class WrongAnimal {
protected:
    std::string type;
public:
    WrongAnimal() : type("WrongAnimal") { std::cout << "WrongAnimal created.\n"; }
    virtual ~WrongAnimal() { std::cout << "WrongAnimal destroyed.\n"; }
    void makeSound() const { std::cout << "Some wrong animal sound.\n"; }
};

class WrongCat : public WrongAnimal {
public:
    WrongCat() { type = "WrongCat"; std::cout << "WrongCat created.\n"; }
    ~WrongCat() { std::cout << "WrongCat destroyed.\n"; }
    void makeSound() const { std::cout << "Wrong meow!\n"; }
};
```

In these classes, `WrongAnimal` and `WrongCat` illustrate what happens when polymorphism is not implemented correctly. `WrongAnimal` does not use virtual functions for its `makeSound`, which means that it will not exhibit polymorphic behavior when used in a base class pointer context. This demonstrates the importance of using virtual functions to achieve polymorphism in C++.


## Summary

This exercise teaches the importance and implementation of polymorphism in C++ using virtual functions and inheritance. By creating a base class with a virtual function and derived classes that override this function, you can achieve polymorphic behavior, allowing different derived classes to be treated uniformly while still providing their specific implementations. The use of a main function to test this setup shows how polymorphism works in practice.
